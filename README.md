# Tip Calculator project based on the Advent of JS & CSS challenge, Day 6

### The Challenge
The challenge was to build a tip calculator app from scratch that:
1. Allowed the user to input the bill amount and the number of people.
2. Allowed the user to click one of four options to change the tip percentage
3. Any change in the inputs by the user result in an updated tip amount and total per person.

A secondary challenge was to do this in multiple languages. A future goal is to rebuild the project with vainilla JavaScript and TypeScript. 

### Personal goals
1. See how how I can get a LightHouse accessibility score (it was 100%).
2. To start using issues and branches while building the project.
